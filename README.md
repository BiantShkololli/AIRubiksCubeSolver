# AIRubiksCubeSolver

Using TL (Transfer Learning) on the MobileNet-SSD detection model, combined with the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm for classifying colors in the LAB color space, this AI can detect and perceive Rubikâ€™s cubes from your webcam in real time, work out the solution, and show the user how to solve it.
